"The Way Home" is a series of work completed during the pandemic. It addresses my own ambiguous concept of home during these challenging times.

Moving back to Alberta less than a year prior to the pandemic, my joy at returning to the comfort of this most familiar landscape was quickly tempered by the understanding that I couldn't leave. The periods of lockdown left most of us feeling a bit trapped by the very thing that was keeping us safe.

While we struggled with feelings of isolation, we were also aware that this experience was shared by virtually every human being on the planet. This paradoxical experience and change in perspective is reflected in the shifts of scale within the series.

I have attempted to encompass the angst and the sorrow as well as the more hopeful view that this profoundly shared human experience may make us all more aware of our shared fate on this lovely planet.
