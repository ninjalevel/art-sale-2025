I call this series "Back to the Garden" because it is, in many ways, about returning to the source.

In 2022, following some major life changes, I spent some time in Paris. Part of this trip included a pilgrimage of sorts, to Monet's garden in Giverny. As Joni Mitchell says, "We got to get ourselves back to the garden". The garden is place of connection; of reflection; of meditation and inspiration.

I have tried to create an evocation of this place and the experience, rather than a depiction. The landscape is both itself and a representation of my own state of mind.
